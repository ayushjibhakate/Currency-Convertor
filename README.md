The Currency Converter Website is a web-based application designed to help users convert a specific amount from one currency to another using the latest exchange rates. This project was developed using core web technologies: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and logic. It provides an intuitive and responsive interface where users can quickly and easily calculate currency conversions in real-time.

This project is an excellent example of working with third-party APIs, DOM manipulation, and implementing a real-world utility using JavaScript.
